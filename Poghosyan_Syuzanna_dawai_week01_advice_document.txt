Initially, I was pretty sceptic of using any AI tool for my studies or work. However, recently, using it for documenting data has proven to be a valuable experience of mine as it has helped me automate some repetitive tasks or to create shorter and more effective solutions to the tasks I needed to address, such as quickly summarizing datasets, extracting the descriptions of the variables as it did for this assignment, helping with some code chunks to ake the analysis easier,  and formatting documentation. However, you need to be pretty precise in your prompts so that the AI-assisted analysis becomes quicker and actually speeds up the process and reduces errors, not the opposite result, especially when dealing with large datasets. Yet, it's crucial to review what content the AI generated to make sure the information is accurate and relevant. Thus, my advice to fellow students would be to use AI as a tool to enhance efficiency and speed, but always try to check the output to ensure results are interpreted correctly and the insights can be used for the required decision making processes.
